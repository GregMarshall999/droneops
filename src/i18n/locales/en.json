          "a": "It depends. For safety and equipment integrity, we avoid extreme weather conditions. High winds (above 20mph) are a no go, our drones aren't the thunderbirds (yet). We can reschedule for free if conditions are unsafe."
        },
        "licensed": {
          "q": "Are you licensed?",
          "a": "Yes. Current regulations require A1/A3 certificates for our operations. If your project requires a higher level of certification, we can help you with the authorisation process."
        },
        "turnaround": {
          "q": "What is your turnaround time?",
          "a": "Edited images within 24-48 hours. Video projects typically take 3-5 business days depending on complexity."
        },
        "present": {
          "q": "Do I need to be present?",
          "a": "Not always, as long as we have access and a shot list. However, being on-site is recommended for creative direction."
